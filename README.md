## 📝 Description
In this project we are going to deevelop the front-end of an application that dynamically displays information by consuming an API.

The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive and visually appealing platform that allows users to access and analyze relevant data on the behavior of the disease, including the number of infections, recoveries and people vaccinated.

It will be a React-based web application that allows users to visualize in an intuitive and understandable way the latest data related to Covid-19. Through this Dashboard, we aim to provide an effective tool for situation analysis and informed decision making.
